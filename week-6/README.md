# Week 6

## Week Overview

This week will see the project proposal presentations. Submit them as PDF slide decks. Please submit your presentations as a pull request to project-proposal directory of week-6 under the branch `proposal-presentations` from your forked repo. Most likely you will need to sync your forked repo to be up to date to mine.  You should also keep a copy of these in your final-project repo as well. 

In the second part of the class, once the presentations are complete, there will be a lecture on creating a local API using a model through [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). 

## Resources

A few slides about APIs and Flask.
