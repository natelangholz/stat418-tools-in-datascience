# Homework 3

Create a standalone github repo called `Mtcars Flask Api`. Use the mtcars.csv dataset to create a predictive linear model using `mpg` as a reponse and any (or all) other remaining variables as predictors using Python in a Docker container. 

With the predictive model create a local flask API that is functional using a Docker container. Someone else should be able to stumble across your repo, clone it, and reproduce your results.

This github repo should contain a README explaining what is included in the repo and what is being done.

There should also be directions (possibly in another README in another directory) on how to standup your API on a local machine. Give an example input and output, so that if I run the API I will get the exact same results as the repo details.

To submit, create a separate markdown file simple with your name and title of this homework that is a link to your repo. Name this file `<your-name>_hw3.md` and create a pull request to the week-6 homework submission directory under the homeowork3-submission branch. 

This is due Week 8, May 21, 2019 at 6pm.
