# Week 9

## Week Overview

This week will see the final lecture of the course and ultimately the final Data Science 'tool' to add to your tool belt. There is a separate github repo, [Dash-app-418](https://github.com/natelangholz/dash-app-418), as in previous weeks that is clone-able and executable through Docker-compose syntax by way of `docker-compose up`

## Resources

[Slides]()

Nice blog post comparison of [Shiny vs Dash](https://www.rkingdc.com/blog/2019/3/6/shiny-vs-dash-a-side-by-side-comparison?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Blog-RKingDataConsulting+%28R+Blog+-+R.+King+Data+Consulting%29) - R. King Data Consulting. It also has example code for both types of apps that build a model using the MTcars data set (which we used in hw3) with a nice interface to get an output. Adapting either of these examples for your final project and deploying to the web would be a final 'product' output.


A bunch of examples of [different Dash apps](https://dash-simple-apps.plotly.host/Portal/) some of which you should be able to replicate if you wish. Here is a [github repo](https://github.com/plotly/simple-example-chart-apps) with a bunch of code examples of small Dash apps as well.
