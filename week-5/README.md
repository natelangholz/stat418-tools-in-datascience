# Week 5

## Week Overview

This week is going to see a change in operations. Last week we saw a almost a critical mass of people had changed their forked version of their repos significantly enough that were having difficulty syncing upstream. If you didn't fall behind continue to do so! Actually you should all continue to do so, but this week we're gonna start with a fresh repo for you all that you will all simply clone. We will also spend some time working on the final project at the end of today. 

## Resources

At the moment there are no slides, but head over to [Deep Learning Frameworks](https://github.com/natelangholz/dl-frameworks) github repo where there are a number of new notebooks, directories, and resources for today's lecture.
