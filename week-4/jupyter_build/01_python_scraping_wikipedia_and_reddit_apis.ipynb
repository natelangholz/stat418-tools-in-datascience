    "\n",
    "Consider the Wikipedia page for [George H.W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush). This seems like a relatively straightforward webpage to scrape out the hyperlinks to other articles or to compare the content to other presidential biographies. However, Wikipedia also preserves the [history of every revision made to this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_H._W._Bush&action=history) going back to the first (available) revisions in 2001, like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_H._W._Bush&oldid=345784898). Thinking back to the Oscars example, it seems promising to find the \"oldid\" values and visit each revision's webpage to parse the content out. However, Wikipedia will give you much of this revision history data for free through its [application programming interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php) (API).\n",
