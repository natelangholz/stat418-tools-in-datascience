The github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/CU-ITSS/Web-Data-Scraping-S2019) [Spring 2019 ITSS Mini-Course] The course is taught by [Brian C. Keegan, Ph.D.](http://brianckeegan.com/) [Assistant Professor, Department of Information Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/information-science/brian-c-keegan). They have been adapted for relevant content and integration with Docker so that we all have the same environment.
